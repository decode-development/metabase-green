# Metabase Teal

A custom-branded fork of [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) (OSS edition), maintained under the terms of the [AGPL v3 license](LICENSE-AGPL.txt).

No functional changes are made to the core Metabase product. All upstream features, connectors, and APIs are preserved as-is.

## Branding

### Colour Palette

| Role | Hex | Used for |
|------|-----|----------|
| Primary brand | `#135756` | Buttons, links, interactive elements |
| Nav background | `#012D2C` | Top navigation and admin bar |
| Nav deep | `#001A19` | Inverse/depth nav backgrounds |
| Accent gold | `#E2B018` | Warnings and highlights |
| Accent cream | `#FDF0C8` | Warning backgrounds |
| Subtle background | `#E0E6E6` | Light UI backgrounds |

All colour references in the UI are CSS variables that derive from a single `--mb-color-brand` value. Changing the three files below is sufficient to retheme the entire application.

**Modified files:**
- `frontend/src/metabase/ui/colors/constants/themes/light.ts`
- `frontend/src/metabase/ui/colors/constants/themes/dark.ts`

### Font

The default UI font is **Poppins** (already bundled with Metabase upstream). Changed in:
- `src/metabase/appearance/settings.clj` — `:default "Poppins"`

## Upstream

This fork tracks the official [metabase/metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) OSS releases. Automation for keeping the fork in sync and publishing Docker images is described in the sections below as each workflow is introduced.

## Automation

### Workflow Management — `teal-enforce-workflows.yml`

Metabase upstream ships ~100 GitHub Actions workflows. On a fork, all of them are inherited and enabled by default. The enforce workflow disables any workflow whose filename does not start with `teal-`, keeping only this fork's own automations active.

**Triggers:**
- Automatically on any push to `master` that touches `.github/workflows/` — catches new upstream workflows arriving via a sync merge
- Manual dispatch — use this for the **initial bulk disable** after first push

**Initial setup:** after pushing this repository for the first time, run the workflow manually via:
> Actions → Enforce Workflow Allowlist → Run workflow
